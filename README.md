ReadMore is a single app to view websites which do not have their own app without having to use bookmarks or other solutions.

ReadMore has the following goals:
* Manage a set of websites that the user wishes to visit on a regular basis.
* Display the website content suitable for a mobile phone or tablet.
* Notify the user (if desired) when new content appears on the website.

ReadMore is built via React Native (without Expo) and can be run on Android and iOS platforms.

### Android App

The android app can be run via the following command:

`npm run android`

(This assumes ruby version 3.4.5 is set via `rvm use 3.4.5`)

### iOS App

The iOS app can be run via the following command:

`npm run ios`

(This assumes ruby version 3.4.5 is set via `rvm use 3.4.5`)
